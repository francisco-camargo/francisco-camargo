# Installation

To work with `.tex` files, first install [LaTeX](https://miktex.org/download) and then install an editor, I prefer [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

# Bibliography

Add the new citation to the `.bib` file.

If you don't see the bibliography right away when you compile the document, run "Quick Build" a couple times, followed by "BibTeX" mode once, followed by "Quick Build" mode one or two more times.

# Templates

* [Double column report](https://github.com/francisco-camargo/latex-template-double-column-report)
